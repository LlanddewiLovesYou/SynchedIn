### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn storybook`

Runs the storybook for this project. Open [http://localhost:6006](http://localhost:6006) to view the stories in the browser.

I used storybook to develop the components before pieceing them all together. The stories themselves are not as fleshed out as I would normally like to have them to show to someone else, but I'm including them anyway as a bonus.
